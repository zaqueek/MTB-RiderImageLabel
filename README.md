# MTB-RiderImageLabel

Its a Python script to label all your photos of riders for Roots&amp;Rain.

Its simple to use, just put your original unnamed photos in the "Input" folder and run the script.

Nothing here is currently finished ive been doing some testing and stuff to see if things are working properly before i full train the ai and deploy everthing.

**IMPORTANT**
Currently only the lighter less acurate model is avilible wile a figure out a way to upload the larger model because its large file size.
